# Zero State

**Transform your New Tab page into a blank space for links and notes.**

## Why Zero State?

- **Ultralight** - Pure vanilla JS/CSS with zero dependencies
- **Private** - No tracking or third-party servers; all data stays in your browser
- **Syncs Automatically** - Changes instantly appear across all your devices via Chrome Storage API
- **Flexible Organization** - Arrange content as lists, trees, or both based on your workflow

## Getting Started

1. **Add items** with the [+] button in the top right
2. **Create nodes** with a unique name (URLs optional)
3. **Build hierarchies** by specifying parent nodes
4. **Mark as complete** with right-click for strikethrough effect
5. **Remove items** using the delete button (appears next to leaf nodes when in add mode)

*Zero State respects your workflow - no forced formats, just the organization system you need.*
